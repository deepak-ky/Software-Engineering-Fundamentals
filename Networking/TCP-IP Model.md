TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. TCP/IP is a set of standardized rules that allow computers to communicate on a network such as the internet. 


**How do TCP and IP differ?**
TCP and IP are two separate computer network protocols. 

IP is the part which obtains the address to which the data is sent. TCP is responsible for data delivery once that IP Address has been found. 

**What does TCP/IP do, exactly and how does it work?**
TCP/IP was developed by the US department of defence to specify how computers transfer data from one device to another. TCP/IP puts a lot of emphasis on accuracy, and it has several steps to ensure that data is correctly transmitted between the two computers.
