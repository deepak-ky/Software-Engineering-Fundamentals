Protocols are rules that govern how data is formatted and sent over a network. 


TCP and UDP are two different methods for doing the same job, ie. transferring data over the internet.  They enable servers and devices to communicate so you can send emails, watch Netflix, play games and browse web pages.





##### Layer 4 Protocols (Transport Layer)

The Key protocols in layer 4 are
1. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
2. UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

These protocols handle end-to-end communication and data transfer between devices over a network.






The main difference between TCP and UDP is that TCP is connection based protocol and UDP is connectionless. While TCP is more reliable it transfers data more slowly. UDP is less reliable but works more quickly. This makes each protocol suited for a different type of data transfer.
